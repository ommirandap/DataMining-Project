### Introduction
This project was created as an exploratory assingment about Data Mining. The main object was to create a DataSet about Chilean's Elections (for President).

### Files

We provide a few scripts for recover and process data from the Dataset (provided by us too). 

### Use
If you want to use an script, just have to run the python script with the input JSON file as an argument.
Like this:

	%python script.py input_file.js

Where script.py, can be any file under the /Sripts path
